The raw data was imported into a new excel worksheet, duplicate values were removed from the data, float type of data was converted to integer where needed, new column, "Revenue" was added by calculating the ordered quantity by the unit price of the ordered item. 

Several pivot tables were created in order to analyse the data and display different charts. Finally slicers and other visual details were configured.
