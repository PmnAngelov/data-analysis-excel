Sales data analysis and dashboard made in Excel.

The data is about a fictional company selling a variety of products for the years 2018 and 2019. The Excel Dashboard analyses that data and provides an overview of the metrics and other data points in one place. The dashboard not only provides consolidated data views, but a self-service business intelligence opportunity, where users are able to filter the data to display just what's important to them.

The raw data was imported into a new excel worksheet, duplicate values were removed from the data, float type of data was converted to integer where needed, new column, "Revenue" was added by calculating the ordered quantity by the unit price of the ordered item. 

Several pivot tables were created in order to analyse the data and display different charts. Finally slicers and other visual details were configured.
