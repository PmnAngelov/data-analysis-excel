This project involves analyzing a sales dataset using Microsoft Excel's built-in functions and tools such as PivotTables, charts, and graphs to gain insights and optimize sales performance. 

The dataset is about a fictional company selling a variety of products for the years 2018 and 2019 and it contains information about sales transactions, products, customers, and sales representatives. The aim of this project is to analyze the data and provide actionable insights that can help the business increase sales revenue.

The project starts by importing the dataset into Excel and cleaning and preprocessing the data. 

The raw data was imported into a new excel worksheet, duplicate values were removed from the data, float type of data was converted to integer where needed, new column, "Revenue" was added by calculating the ordered quantity by the unit price of the ordered item. 

The data is then analyzed using Excel to visualize and summarize the data. Several pivot tables were created as an interactive way to quickly summarize the data in order to analyse it and display different charts. Finally slicers and other visual details were configured.
